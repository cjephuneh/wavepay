# WavePay

WavePay is a mobile application designed to help users manage their internet service providers (ISPs) in one place. With WavePay, users can track internet usage, view balances, check remaining days, and make payments for their internet services. The app also provides a platform for ISPs to add their pricing tiers, payment methods, and other important details for their customers.

## Features

- **ISP Integration:** Users can select their ISP and view relevant details like usage, balance, and plan information.
- **Payment Tracking:** Users can track their payments, make partial payments, and save up for the next payment.
- **ISP Dashboard:** ISPs can manage and update their plans, pricing tiers, and payment methods through a dedicated dashboard.
- **Notifications:** Users receive alerts about their plan status, remaining days, and payment due dates.
- **Secure Payment Gateway:** Users can securely make payments via multiple methods supported by their ISP.
